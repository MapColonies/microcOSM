# microcOSM

Historically microcosm aimed to provide an easily installable package for the OpenStreetMap software stack, see [legacy branch](https://github.com/MapColonies/microcOSM/tree/legacy) for more details

This branch is a minimized version of the same ecosystem, here you can find the `openstreetmap-website` and `cgimap` components provided with docker container definitions, along with configuration scripts to run on a Kubernetes cluster.
